   <h1> My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>

    Outside of University, I have many interests including Performing arts. I am a part of numerous choirs and have performed in Venice and competed in Songs of Praise and UGCY. I have attended many operas and ballets in London. 
    I enjoy swimming, going to the gym and have competed in the London Youth Games for Netball. 
    I also love travelling and go on numerous trips throughout the year.
